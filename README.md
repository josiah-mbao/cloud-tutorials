**Welcome to JOSS, the living documentation for my journey in Systems Engineering, DevOps, and AI.**

This repository hosts a collection of practical, hands-on tutorials designed to help you bridge the gap between writing code and shipping it reliably to production. Built by a 4th-year Software Engineering student and GDSC Cloud Lead with roots in Zambia and based in Kenya, this resource focuses on actionable solutions for real-world development challenges in the African tech space.
