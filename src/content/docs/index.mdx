# ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª Building in the Cloud: My Systems Engineering Journey

What's good! Iâ€™m Josiah, a **4th-year Software Engineering student** currently based in Kenya, though my journey started in **Zambia**. I'm also the **Cloud & DevOps Lead for GDSC** on my campus.

Like many of you, I've spent the past few years juggling classes, grinding on side projects, and learning how to bridge the gap between writing code (Dev) and **shipping** it reliably to the world (Ops). This blog is about achieving that **quiet and undeniable consistency** where our engineering habits pay off.

This is where Iâ€™m turning all that hard-earned knowledgeâ€”the MLOps projects, the high-performance Go networking systems, the Kubernetes configs, and the "aha!" momentsâ€”into **actionable, hands-on tutorials** using Markdown and **Astro**.

You'll find content focused on the essential tools and concepts that take you from *local development* to **scalable, production-ready systems**, with a specific focus on impactful solutions for Africa.

## ðŸš€ What We'll Explore

This content is structured to take you from zero to deployment hero, mirroring the real-world skills demanded by modern tech roles.

| Path | Focus | Key Topics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Foundations** | The bedrock of all modern infrastructure. | **DevOps Culture**, **Cloud Computing Overview**, **Linux Basics**. |
| **Containers** | Packaging applications for consistent deployment. | **Docker Basics** (building images), **Docker Compose** (multi-container apps). |
| **CI/CD** | Automating the software release process. | **Introduction to CI/CD**, Hands-on with **GitHub Actions** and **Azure Pipelines**. |
| **Kubernetes** | Orchestrating containerized applications at scale. | **K8s Introduction**, **Pods & Services**, Managing releases with **Helm**. |

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Blog? Projects Over Theory

We learn best by **doing**. Every guide here is a practical write-up based on real systems Iâ€™ve built or worked on. Weâ€™ll look at:

* **MLOps Systems:** How I containerized and deployed **Ona Vision** to **Kubernetes** with full **Prometheus** and **Grafana** observability.
* **High-Performance Go:** Building the **Go Reverse Proxy** from scratch and deploying it with modern tooling.
* **API Optimization:** The practical steps taken to improve the **Django REST API latency** during my internship.

My goal is simple: to break down the technical barriers, offer a clear pan-African perspective on global tech trends, and give you the confidence to start building and deploying your own amazing ideas.
